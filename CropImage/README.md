Crop-Image
==========


Overview: This is a Java project to design an algorithm for Image-cropping.

In Java file, I used Java awt,
MouseListener, MouseMotionListener which implement get the image info.
Also, used the JLabel as a statusBar to show the gotten image info.

Let's run the project step by step:

1. Input a image file called LandScape.jpg. When you move the mouse curor on the image, it will display the location of the mouse and the color of the pixel at that location.
